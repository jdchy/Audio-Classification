  The wavfiles contain 10 classes of data each one have 30 samples
  The instruments.csv file has the label of each of this wavfile 
  The clean directory contains all the clean wavfile after pre processing

<h2> Models and Pickles <h2>
  <p> There are two models implemented. One is the convolutional model and another one is recurrent model. In the pickles directory the x and y values are stored and the resulting model is saved into the models directory. <p>
<h2> Prediction <h2>
  <p> The predict.py file is used for making prediction on the existing data and the result has been saved onto prediction.csv file <p>
